        The public key was mathematically not correctly generated.
        (It would have been nicer if we would have used BAD_PUBKEY for
        this, but that error code is in long time use to describe for
        example policy and encoding problems with a key.  Using
        INV_PUBKEY would have been better for these purposes)

GPG_ERR_LDAP_GENERAL		LDAP General error

   Catch all error for LDAP.  Use if if can't map an erro rocde to an
   gpg-error code.

GPG_ERR_LDAP_ATTR_GENERAL	LDAP General attribute error
GPG_ERR_LDAP_NAME_GENERAL	LDAP General name error
GPG_ERR_LDAP_SECURITY_GENERAL	LDAP General security error

GPG_ERR_LDAP_X_GENERAL	        LDAP Private error code
GPG_ERR_LDAP_OTHER_GENERAL	LDAP Other general error

  All above may be used to map ranges of LDAP errors to one specific
  code. OpenLDAP uses LDAP_xxx_RANGE(n) macros for tha mapping.
  "Other general error" may be used similar to "General error" for
  mapping of ranges.  Here are macros from OpenLDAP for reference

  #define LDAP_ATTR_ERROR(n)	 LDAP_RANGE((n),0x10,0x15) /* 16-21 */
  #define LDAP_NAME_ERROR(n)	 LDAP_RANGE((n),0x20,0x24) /* 32-34,36 */
  #define LDAP_SECURITY_ERROR(n) LDAP_RANGE((n),0x2F,0x32) /* 47-50 */
  #define LDAP_SERVICE_ERROR(n)	 LDAP_RANGE((n),0x33,0x36) /* 51-54 */
  #define LDAP_UPDATE_ERROR(n)	 LDAP_RANGE((n),0x40,0x47) /* 64-69,71 */
  #define LDAP_E_ERROR(n)	 LDAP_RANGE((n),0x1000,0x3FFF)
  #define LDAP_X_ERROR(n)	 LDAP_RANGE((n),0x4000,0xFFFF)
